Modern Login and Dashboard System
The Modern Login and Dashboard System is a web-based application developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. The main objective of this project is to create a secure login system and a professional dashboard interface that allows users to access and manage system features easily.This project focuses on providing a clean design, secure authentication, and a user-friendly experience suitable for modern web applications.

The system begins with a login page where users enter their username and password. The login interface is designed with a modern layout, centered form, and gradient background to enhance visual appearance and usability. When the user submits their login information, the system verifies the credentials using the MySQL database. If the information is correct, the user is granted access to the dashboard. If the credentials are incorrect, access is denied, ensuring the security of the system.
